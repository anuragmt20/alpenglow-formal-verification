# Technical Report: Formal Verification of Alpenglow Consensus

## Executive Summary

This report documents the formal verification of Solana's Alpenglow consensus protocol using TLA+. Our verification covers the core safety, liveness, and resilience properties of the protocol.

## Verification Approach

### Modeling Decisions
1. Abstracted cryptographic details to focus on consensus logic
2. Modeled stake distribution as discrete values
3. Simplified network model with non-deterministic message delivery
4. Represented timeouts using abstract conditions

### Properties Verified

#### Safety Properties
- [ ] No conflicting finalization
- [ ] Chain consistency under Byzantine faults
- [ ] Certificate uniqueness

#### Liveness Properties
- [ ] Progress under partial synchrony
- [ ] Fast path completion with sufficient stake
- [ ] Bounded finalization time

#### Resilience Properties
- [ ] Safety with ≤20% Byzantine stake
- [ ] Liveness with ≤20% non-responsive stake
- [ ] Network partition recovery
